# The TO-DO list

There are many things left to implement in SST! If you want to make
suggestions, please get in touch and offer some feedback.

* The user interface is only provisional, so there are many things to do to improve style and colouration.
The focus has been on obtaining a "responsive" design that will work on all devices, large and small. This is obviously both a challenge and a matter of individual taste.

* * Fetch on demand for second orbit layer in NCCS search

* * Focal view for naturally hierarchical data (like music collection or directory listing).

* * Exploit the ts_vector combinatorics in search

* * User-selected colours and styles

* * Using Images and other Media Types more seamlessly as nodes in a graph is desirable. Presently, one can give a URL to an image or resource, but the browsing experience is incomplete.

* * Reading text out loud (in multiple languages) is desirable.

* * Improved learning goals and tracking.

* * Hosted platform for the compiler and database, with file uploading for portability. This involves a whole new level of user authentication and security, etc. A major project.

* * Validation of Events, Things, Concepts in graph compilation, and tagging of inferred type (checking for nonsense).

* * Provenance and attribution of sources, through notes.

* * Inhibition contexts; implementation of NOT in searches (see the ts_vector notes).

* * Handle link weights in searches

* * Help assistant for breaking down text into atomic structures with standard link types.

* * Legal document analysis.

## Hardware

* * Raspberry Pi style wearable device.

## Conversion data projects

* * Product catalogue with annotation.

* * UPnP scan and data input, e.g. music library.

* * Index an existing SQL database.

* * Convert an RDF graph into SST.

* * Inventory / asset graph.

* * Log data analysis.
