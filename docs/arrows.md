# How to use arrows

Getting to grips with notes can feel like a challenge, so don't try to do too much.
It's a simple knowledge management lesson: start with fundamentals and turn them into habits,
then you can build on that.

Try starting with these basic arrows:

* `(then)` - a LEADSTO arrow. You can always join up subsequent events `a (then) b (then) c` etc.
Even if this isn't very specific, you will understand what it means, and you can always go back and change it.

* `(contains)` - a CONTAINS arrows, pretty obvious, though not as common as we might think.

* `(see)` - a NEAR of SIMILAR arrow, useful for just adding a kind of footnote.

Then the most common kind of arrow is EXPRESS PROPERTY, so we add a few that are in common
usage:

* `(e.g.)` - for example, add an example of the thing before the arrow
* `(note)` - add a note about the thing before the arrow
* `(tbd)` - "to be discussed/decided" no idea how to label this, will come back to it! 


This is enough. Now make notes!

## Editing your own arrows

To create new arrows, you go to the `SST-config/` sub-directory, either in your current directory
or the one above it. Each type of arrow has its own file. You can add as many lines as you like
in the form:

<pre>
 +  forward arrow meaning (short name) - backward arrow meaning (bwd alias)
</pre>
